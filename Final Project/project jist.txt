Project:

Oline casino, 15+ countries (Scandinavian), 4500 players a day.

Conversion Rate: Time from signup to first time deposit. (deposit as in first time gambling?) 
- How is the conversion rate distributed?
- 
Bayesian inference, emcee, prior, posterior, likelihood
Changes between different countries.

Does higher welcome offer affect the conversion rate?

Turn over: How much money a player plays in a given period. 
How is turn over distributed

compare differences marketing sources ability to bring in players.

Expected results: 
    conversion rate normal distribution with mean 60% and ? std.
    turn over - poisson mu = 600 euro
